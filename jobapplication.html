  <li data-sourcepos="3:1-3:364"><strong>Quantify your accomplishments.</strong> For example, instead of saying "successfully managed a large portfolio of technology products / programs," say "successfully managed a portfolio of 10+ technology products / programs with a total budget of $50M." This will give potential employers a better understanding of the scope of your work and the impact you have made.</li>
  <li data-sourcepos="4:1-4:343"><strong>Use keywords throughout your resume.</strong> When employers are searching for candidates, they often use applicant tracking systems (ATS) to scan resumes for relevant keywords. Make sure to include keywords from the job descriptions you are applying to throughout your resume, especially in your skills section and work experience descriptions.</li>
  <li data-sourcepos="5:1-6:0"><strong>Tailor your resume to each job you apply for.</strong> Take the time to read carefully through each job description and highlight the skills and experience that are most relevant to the position. You may also want to consider writing a unique cover letter for each job you apply for.</li>
