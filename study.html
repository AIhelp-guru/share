Uniform motion in one dimension refers to the motion of an object along a straight line at a constant velocity. </p> </div> </div> <div class="section"> <h2 class="section-heading">Key Concepts and Questions</h2> <div class="prefilled-content"> <ul> <li>What is the definition of uniform motion in one dimension?</li> <li>How can we mathematically describe the position, velocity, and acceleration of an object undergoing uniform motion?</li> <li>What are the kinematic equations that relate the position, velocity, time, and acceleration of an object in uniform motion?</li> <li>How can we apply the concepts of uniform motion to analyze and solve real-world problems?</li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="section"> <h2 class="section-heading">Research Resources</h2> <div class="prefilled-content"> <ul> <li>Textbook: "Physics for Scientists and Engineers" by Serway and Jewett</li> <li>Online resource: Khan Academy's "Kinematics in One Dimension" tutorial</li> <li>Scientific article: "Kinematics of Uniform Motion" by Dr. John Doe</li> <li>Video tutorial: "Introduction to Kinematics" by The Physics Classroom</li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="section"> <h2 class="section-heading">My notes</h2> <div class="prefilled-content"> <ul> <li>Uniform motion in one dimension is defined as the motion of an object along a straight line at a constant velocity.</li> <li>The kinematic equations that describe uniform motion in one dimension are: <ul> <li>x = x₀ + vt (position)</li> <li>v = v₀ (velocity)</li> <li>a = 0 (acceleration)</li> </ul> </li> <li>These equations relate the position (x), initial position (x₀), velocity (v), initial velocity (v₀), time (t), and acceleration (a).</li> <li>Practical applications of uniform motion include the motion of a car on a highway, a train on a track, and a ball rolling on a level surface.</li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="section"> <h2 class="section-heading">Ask</h2> <div class="student-input" contenteditable="true" placeholder="Enter your key findings and information here..."></div> <div class="guidance"> In this section, summarize the key information and findings you have learned about Kinematics in one dimension: uniform motion.
